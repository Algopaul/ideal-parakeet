# Swirl-LM: Computational Fluid Dynamics in TensorFlow

Swirl-LM is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation framework that is
accelerated by the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). It solves the three dimensional
variable-density Navier-Stokes equation using a low-Mach approximation, and the
governing equations are discretized by a finite-difference method on a
collocated structured mesh. It is implemented in TensorFlow.
